"""Order the review queue by investigative value.

A sweep can stage hundreds of DRAFT findings, and they are reviewed in whatever
order the backend appended them. Examiner attention is the scarcest resource in
the platform and it is currently spent uniformly.

This module scores each finding on a handful of **independent, explainable**
signals and combines them with weights the examiner can see. It is deliberately
not a model:

* It is reproducible — the same case ranks identically on every machine, which
  a probabilistic score cannot promise.
* It needs no network, so it is safe in the approval path of an air-gapped
  workstation.
* Every point of the score can be traced to a named signal, and
  ``--explain`` prints that breakdown. In a forensic tool an opaque ranking is
  worse than no ranking: the examiner has to be able to disagree with it.

**Ordering only.** Nothing here filters, hides, approves, rejects or writes
``status``. The examiner still sees every item. Scores are recomputed on read
and never stored — a finding's ``content_hash`` covers every field that is not
explicitly excluded, so writing a score into the finding would invalidate its
integrity check.
